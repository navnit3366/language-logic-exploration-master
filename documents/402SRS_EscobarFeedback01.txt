TextBooked Project SRS Evaluation
=================================

This is kind of light-weight, in terms of a requirements document.  I'm
sorry if this sounds harsh, but there's barely enough in here to see what
the project is about, let alone what you are building.  For this to be a
good requirements document, ESPECIALLY for something as complicated as NLP,
there needs to be a definition of the lexicon you are using, some way of
describing what NLP engine you'll be writing or integrating, and some way
of telling the programmer what code to write.  For things like item 2 in
section 5.2.1, for example, all you say is "denote when a statement may
be incomplete or syntactially incorrect", but you don't say what that will
look like to the user; will it be a pop-up message?  Will it appear as
the text is entered, or does the user have to click something?  In the
requirement statement 3 in section 5.2.1, what is meant by "cleanly" and
"properly"?  What is "cleanly" defined as?  What is used to determine
what is "properly" formatted?

Again, not to sound harsh, but this seems kind of underwhelming....

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
